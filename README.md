# Searching-In-Data-Structure-using-Java
Searching in DS using Java involves finding an element in a collection like an array. Linear Search checks each element sequentially (O(n) time), while Binary Search works on sorted data by dividing the search interval (O(log n) time). These algorithms are essential for efficient data retrieval and problem-solving in Java.
